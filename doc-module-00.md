## Preparing a your Lab environment

- This module is for configuring your dev environment
- We will show the set up process of Cloud9 Env and Node Develpoment environment.
- Cloud 9 is recommended as your dev IDE for studying this workshop

## 1. Using Cloud9

### 1.1. Create your Cloud9 environments

##### Launch your instance

1.  Specify Environment name : "YOUR INITIAL-workshop"

![ec2 instance](./imgs/00/01.png)

2.  Select "Create a new instance"
3.  Select "t2.small"

### 1.2 Update your environment

1.  Run the yum update command to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed

```
$ sudo yum -y update
```

2.  Run this command to install the latest version of Node.js.

```
$ nvm install node
```

### 1.3 Configure your Node environment

1.  Check node version and check the location of Node

```
$ node -v
v10.7.0

$ which node
~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.7.0/bin/node
```

2.  Run this command to initialise Node project, accept all defaults by hitting **enter** 10 times

```
$ npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
