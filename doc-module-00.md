### 1.2 Update your environment

- Follow Step 1 in "Node.js Sample for AWS Cloud9"

ref : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/sample-nodejs.html

### 1.3 Update your environment (optional reference)

1.  Check node version and check the location of Node

```
$ node -v
v10.7.0

$ which node
~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.7.0/bin/node
```

2.  Initialise Node project packages

```
$ npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
