## Deployment with Elastic Beanstalk Command (EB) Line Interface (CLI)

### 1. Setup EB CLI

#### 1.1 Install EB CLI

1.  Run this command to install EB CLI

```
$ pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user
```

2.  Verify EB CLI is installed

```
$ eb --version

EB CLI 3.14.3 (Python 2.7.1)
```

#### 1.2 Configure EB CLI

1.  Initialise your Git repository

```
$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ec2-user/environment/beanstalk-workshop/.git/

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "first commit"
```

EB CLI will now recognize that your application is set up with Git.

2.  Initialise EB application

```
$ eb init
```

2.  Enter **7** to select Singapore region

```
Select a default region
1) us-east-1 : US East (N. Virginia)
2) us-west-1 : US West (N. California)
3) us-west-2 : US West (Oregon)
4) eu-west-1 : EU (Ireland)
5) eu-central-1 : EU (Frankfurt)
6) ap-south-1 : Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7) ap-southeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Singapore)
8) ap-southeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Sydney)
9) ap-northeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
10) ap-northeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Seoul)
11) sa-east-1 : South America (Sao Paulo)
12) cn-north-1 : China (Beijing)
13) cn-northwest-1 : China (Ningxia)
14) us-east-2 : US East (Ohio)
15) ca-central-1 : Canada (Central)
16) eu-west-2 : EU (London)
17) eu-west-3 : EU (Paris)
(default is 3): 7
```

3.  Enter **beanstalk-workshop** as application name

```
Enter Application Name
(default is "beanstalk-workshop"): beanstalk-workshop
```

4.  Enter **Y** to select Node.js platform

```
It appears you are using Node.js. Is this correct?
(Y/n): Y
```

5.  Enter **y** to continue with CodeCommit with Elastic Beanstalk

```
WARNING: Git is in a detached head state. Using branch "default".
Note: Elastic Beanstalk now supports AWS CodeCommit; a fully-managed source control service. To learn more, see Docs: https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/
Do you wish to continue with CodeCommit? (y/N) (default is n): y
```

6.  Enter **1** to create a new CodeCommit repository

```
Select a repository
1) [ Create new Repository ]
(default is 1): 1
```

Enter a name for your repository, I've chosen **"beanstalk-workshop"** in the following example

```
Enter Repository Name
(default is "origin"):  beanstalk-workshop
```

Enter a name for your branch, I've chosen **"master"** in the following example

```
Enter Branch Name
***** Must have at least one commit to create a new branch with CodeCommit *****
(default is "master"): master
```

7.  Enter **n** when prompted to setup SSH access

```
Cannot setup CodeCommit because there is no Source Control setup, continuing with initialization
Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(Y/n): n
```

### 2. Setup repository configuration

As a best practice for Node, we should not commit our dependencies to our repository

1.  Run the command to tell git to ignore the **node_modules** folder

```
$ echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
```

### 3. Deploy application with EB CLI

#### 3.1 Create EB environment

1.  Run eb create command to create an EB environment. This creates an environment and deploys your application

```
$ eb create sample-node-env1 --elb-type application
```

#### 3.2 View deployed application

1.  Navigate to the EB service, and select your newly created environment **sample-node-env1**

![newly created environment](./imgs/02/01.png)

2.  Access your application via the URL shown

![environment URL](./imgs/02/02.png)

You'll be greeted with the hello world message

![node hello world](./imgs/02/03.png)
